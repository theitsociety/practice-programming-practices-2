Variable types

     byte - 8
     short - 16
     int - 32
     long - 64

     float - 32
     double - 64

     boolean - 1 - true-false
     char - 16

    String - character array - ["H","e","l","l","o"]


 Is String a Primitive or a Derived Type? Why?
     A String is a derived type since it has state and behavior.
     For example, it has methods like substring(), indexOf(), and equals(), which primitives cannot have.

     it has some special characteristics that make it feel like a primitive:
     	 	While strings are not stored on the call stack like primitives are, they are stored in a special memory region called the string pool

     	 	Java String Pool is the special memory region where Strings are stored by the JVM.

     	 	Like primitives, we can use the + operator on strings

     	 	And again, like primitives, we can create an instance of a String without the new keyword


Is string mutable or immutable ? (Str class)

String literal vs String object (Str2 class)

String vs StringBuilder vs StringBuffer ?


Questions
    1. Check if the two strings are anagram
            an anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase.
            heart - earth / race - care
        - sort and compare
        - counting

    2. Reverse String  // hello
        - Create a new String and compare
        - Swapping characters
        - StringBuilder
    3. check if a String is Palindrome ?
         -Palindrome - A palindrome is any sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward, such as “madam”, “radar” or “level”.
